## How To Use Emojis
> + For default emojis, you can just use :emojiname: e.g `:white_check_mark:`
> + For custom emojis, write `\:emojiname:` into a channel. Discord will then automatically convert it into what is required and you can then just paste that into the message in the config.  

## How To Write With Multiple Lines
> + In the message, replace each new line with `\n`
> + As an example, `"**Checkout Our Store**\n*It Is Very Cool*\n\nhttp://boosts.lol"`


## To Skids
> + If you're going to skid, at least leave a star for my efforts.
